# Fuck-It-Up-Translator
A random program I made out of boredom. Translates a phrase to an amount of different languages, then back into your desired language.

# Suggestions
If you have a suggestions, send me a discord message (RandomB#6160) or make an issue!

# Features
1. Phrase Translate (translates a phrase you enter, doesn't work with new lines)
2. File Translate (translates text.txt, works with new lines)
3. Change settings within the program itself
(changeable settings include: export language, toggleable seed input, similarity toggle, setting delay between translations, amount of languages to translate to)
4. Help (explains what every settings item does)

# Problems
1. Help! I get: AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'

Solution: Run "pip install googletrans==4.0.0-rc1" in whatever terminal you use.
